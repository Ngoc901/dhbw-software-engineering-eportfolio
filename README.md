Welcome to my **e-Portfolio** for *Figma Basics for Developers*!
In this tutorial, we’ll **design a login page in Figma**, explore developer features like **Auto Layout** and **Dev Mode**, and then use **Anima** to export the design into real **HTML and CSS** code. You can follow along by accessing the [Figma Workplace](#figma-workplace) I will be working on!

- Inspect and copy code with **Dev Mode**
- Export designs as HTML & CSS using **Anima**
- Open and edit the generated code in **VS Code**
